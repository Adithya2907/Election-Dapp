# Election-Dapp
Created a complete election decentralized application, using Ethereum. 
Coded the smart contracts in Solidity, and used JavaScript as the testing framework. 
Created the front-end using ReactJS and Nextjs.

Clone the app, and run 
`npm install`
to install all the dependencies.

Compile the script using 
`node ethereum/compile.js`

And deploy the script on ganache test network by running
`node ethereum/deploy.js`
Make sure that your ganache is running when you use this command.

Copy the address, and replace it in the address file, and in the election.js file.

Run the command
`npm run dev`

and go to localhost:3002. You Dapp is up and running!
